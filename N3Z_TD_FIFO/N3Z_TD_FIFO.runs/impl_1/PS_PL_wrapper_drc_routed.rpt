DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining

Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/demodulationssb1/mult/comp1.core_instance1/U0/i_mult/gDSP.gDSP_only.iDSP/inferred_dsp.reg_mult.m_reg_reg input PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/demodulationssb1/mult/comp1.core_instance1/U0/i_mult/gDSP.gDSP_only.iDSP/inferred_dsp.reg_mult.m_reg_reg/B[17:0] is not pipelined.

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/demodulationssb1/mult/comp1.core_instance1/U0/i_mult/gDSP.gDSP_only.iDSP/inferred_dsp.reg_mult.m_reg_reg output PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/demodulationssb1/mult/comp1.core_instance1/U0/i_mult/gDSP.gDSP_only.iDSP/inferred_dsp.reg_mult.m_reg_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
