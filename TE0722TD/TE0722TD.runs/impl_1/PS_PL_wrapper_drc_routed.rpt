PREG Output pipelining  
DSP PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/demodulationssb1/mult/comp1.core_instance1/U0/i_mult/gDSP.gDSP_only.iDSP/inferred_dsp.reg_mult.m_reg_reg output PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/demodulationssb1/mult/comp1.core_instance1/U0/i_mult/gDSP.gDSP_only.iDSP/inferred_dsp.reg_mult.m_reg_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

Used physical LUT pin 'A5' of cell PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/dsprocessor1/picoblaze6/use_zero_flag_lut/LUT5 (in PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/dsprocessor1/picoblaze6/use_zero_flag_lut macro) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=(A3*(~A4))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/tonedetect/picoblaze6/fd_prim_array[7].bit_is_0.fdre_comp is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/tonedetect/picoblaze6/bram_w[0]_INST_0/O, cell PS_PL_i/n3z_tonetest_0/inst/n3z_tonetest_struct/tonedetect/picoblaze6/bram_w[0]_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
